**Welcome to the MultiWii Joystick Project**

The Multiwii firmware (as from v2.2) from MultiWii.com provides a RCSERIAL protocol to control your aircraft over serial communication. (replacing your standard RC PWM Reciever system)

But this protocol is not included in the MultiWiiConf GUI that Multiwii.com provides with this firmware version. This project will integerate this feature in to the MultiWiiConf GUI and will provide a small configuration tool to select a joystick or gamepad and set sliders and buttons to a corresponding channel.
