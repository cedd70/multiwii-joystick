# Introduction #

MultWiiConf is a graphical user interface (application) to configure and monitor your MultiWii multirotor.

# Details #

The MultiWiiConf GUI (graphical user interface) is a java program that can run on any PC windows/linux/mac computer.
The Arduino or FC (flight controller) must be connected via an USB cable to the computer to use it.
Alternatively, it is possible to use a wireless transmission via bluetooth as data are transported over a simple serial port.
(not documented, but some managed to do it)

The official MultiWiiconf application can be downloaded from the official multiwii website: http://www.multiwii.com
