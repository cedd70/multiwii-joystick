MultiWii is a general purpose software to control a multirotor RC model.
It can now use various sensors but was initially developed to support Nintendo Wii console gyroscopes and accelerometers.
We can find these sensors in the extensions of the Nintendo WiiMote: Wii Motion Plus and Wii Nunchuk.
This project was an opportunity to develop my own software on an Arduino platform.
The achieved stability is excellent for FPV and allows any kind of acrobatics.
